# Encaosulation lets us hide the internal representation
# of an object from the outside and only exposes the 
# methods and propeties that users of the object need.

# This is a form of data protection because it means
# that things can only be changed with obvious intention.
# We expose properties and methods through the public
# interface of a class: its public methods.
