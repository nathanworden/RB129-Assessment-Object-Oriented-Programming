# What can you say about the relationship between class and objects?

#1) The class is like a blueprint, template, or mold
#2) If the class is a blueprint, the object is a house.
 # The house is literally more concrete.

# An object is an encapsulation of state and behavior.

# Creating objects allows the programmer to think
# on a new level of abstraction. Objects represent real 
# world nouns and can be given methods that describe
# the behavior the programmer is trying to represent.

# What is state?
# State tracks attributes for individual objects.
# State is the value of an object's instance variable.
# Each object has its own state
# State is at the level of the object.
